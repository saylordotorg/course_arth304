**Unit 3: The Nile Valley** <span id="3"></span> 
*The longevity and extensive remains of ancient Egypt – a Hellenized
(Greek) name for the region of Kemet – make the area crucial to the
understanding of many world cultures, including those of Africa south of
the Sahara, which was not always the vast desert that it is today and so
did not always necessarily impede trade with regions to the south. This
unit will discuss how Egyptian art emphasized the notion of the king as
an extension of the divine. Egyptian religion was polytheistic, and
focused on a pantheon that included composite human/animal deities.
While these two Egyptian notions (divine kingship and polytheism) would
prove common in later cultures throughout Africa, the ancient Egyptians’
quest for monumental permanence did not. The seat of power in Egypt
shifted over time. Starting in the Northern delta, royal complexes
gradually moved South into Nubia, in the modern nation of Sudan, which
Egyptians settled by the end of the Dynastic period in the late first
millennium BCE. From there, power shifted eastward to Abyssinia – modern
Ethiopia – into the Christian period.*
