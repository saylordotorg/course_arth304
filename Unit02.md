**Unit 2: The Maghreb: Northernmost Africa and the Sahara** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This section studies prehistoric rock art in the Maghreb and briefly
reviews the history of the region’s development and its present-day
nomadic cultures. Arab culture has affected this region, particularly
through the religious influence of Islam. After conquering the
Phoenicians, the Romans infiltrated North Africa, and while substantial
Roman architectural ruins remain, the Arabs used some of them to
construct mosques. Subsequently, most mosque architecture reflects a
syncretistic blend of Arab traditions and indigenous forms of building
throughout Africa. Note that Muslims pray individually in an open,
communal space, traditionally punctuated by a courtyard area and a
minaret ascended by clergy to call the faithful to* salah *(daily
prayers).*
