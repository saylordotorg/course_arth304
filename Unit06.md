**Unit 6: Central Africa** <span id="6"></span> 
*A number of groups reside across the boundaries of modern eastern
Nigeria and Cameroon along the Cross River. In Cameroon, several
ethnically and culturally related kingship societies nonetheless are
distinct by tradition. In the colonial period, the Congo region
encompassed the modern nations of the Republic of the Congo and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Kongo peoples (including
several sub-groups) extend across the borders of these nations. This
background is important to keep in mind when trying to categorize the
works of the various groups this unit examines because there are not
always clear differences in style or type, and there is much interaction
between the two groups.*
