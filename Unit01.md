**Unit 1: Orientation** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will provide a foundation for the study of African art,
familiarizing you with Africa’s history and geography, introducing
terminology basic to cross-cultural studies, and demonstrating some of
the overlaps and diversity in form and function of objects from
different regions.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 10 hours to complete:  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 5 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   examine the European infiltration of Africa;

     Instructions: In order to approach aspects of African culture
    historically, it is crucial to understand Africa’s evolution and
    current geography. After four centuries of colonization, Europeans
    laid out the beginnings of modern national divisions at the Berlin
    Conference in 1885. Unsurprisingly, indigenous groups did not fit
    these boundaries. Therefore, it is often considered more reflective
    of Africa’s historical situation to discuss the African continent in
    terms of regions.  
        
     This map is a good approximation of the major topological and
    cultural regions: the North (the Maghreb and the Sahara), the Sudan
    (the Sahel and the savannah to the edge of the modern country of
    Sudan), the Nile Valley (Egypt and Nubia), Central Africa, East
    Africa, and Southern Africa. Please note that in 1997, a year after
    this website was created, the country of Zaire in Central Africa was
    renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo under a new regime. A
    set of more current maps is linked below. However, this regional map
    is a clear diagram and includes further resources. Click on any
    section of the map to open up a new webpage with an introduction
    about that area. At the bottom of these pages, click through to
    learn more about each region. Used in this manner, this map serves
    as an overview of this course’s material.

     Instructions: After four centuries of colonization, European powers
    solidified their division of Africa at the Berlin Conference. This
    site provides a detailed account of the Conference as well as a map
    that demonstrates that division, which solidified new national
    boundaries over which European powers ruled well into the
    20<sup>th</sup> century. For comparison, a map of these divisions
    superimposed on a map of modern Africa can be found at UniMaps
    below.

     Instructions: Read this article for an overview of Africa’s major
    ethnic groups. Also note that as we proceed, you will see how larger
    ethnic groups are frequently subdivided into clans and/or by status
    and occupational associations into a proliferation of distinct
    identities that can be confusing and difficult to grasp. Try to get
    a feel for these extended kinship ties and other kinds of basic
    social structures.

    face.
