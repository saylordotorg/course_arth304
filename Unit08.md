**Unit 8: Contemporary African Artists** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn about the spread of African art forms and
contemporary African artists. These are starting points for further
investigation. In discussing and analyzing contemporary African art,
critics have focused on the extent to which expressions of ethnic and
cultural heritage may be intended by particular artists. Pay attention
to how the modern works discussed are described and contextualized
through references to past art as well as to modern art of the West.
Also note how the artists themselves (when applicable) and commentators
describe the meanings and inspirations in these works.*
