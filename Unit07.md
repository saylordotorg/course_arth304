**Unit 7: Eastern and Southern Africa** <span id="7"></span> 
*Swahili is an indigenous East African language and culture that has
been influenced by several centuries of trade with and hegemonic
infiltration by Indian and Arab Islamic culture, as seen in the region’s
architecture. Note that other indigenous groups with strong ethnic
identities extending west from the coast remain in the region. However,
this course’s discussion of these groups is limited due to a lack of
accessible examples. Note that South Africa was the last African country
to maintain legal apartheid (overturned in 1994) and retain white
European rule from the early colonial era. These influences took a toll
on the livelihood of traditional arts crafted by the region’s people. As
a result, we will focus on this area’s early art, with a few limited
examples of more recent objects.*
