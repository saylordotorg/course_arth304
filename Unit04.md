**Unit 4: The Sudan** <span id="4"></span> 
*Islamic movements into Nubia resulted in the emergence of the modern
country of Sudan, a name derived from the Arabic* bilad as-sudan*, “land
of the Blacks.” As Arabs moved westward, “Sudan” referred to a large
swath of territory extending nearly to the western and southern Atlantic
coasts, crossing boundaries of several modern countries and populated
with diverse ethnic groups. Today the area is heavily Muslim, though
many communities integrate Islam with indigenous spiritual traditions.*
